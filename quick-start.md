# Quickstart: GitHub Classroom for Teachers

## Once per teacher / program:

1. Set up a free [GitHub Classroom](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) account.

## Once per course (class that you anticipate teaching multiple times):

1. Create a master organization for the course, e.g., IB-CS-Master
1. Go to your [GitHub Classroom settings](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/64a051cf1598b9f0658f) and grant **organization access** to the master organization you created.

## Once per class (instance of teaching a course):

1. Create an organization for the class, e.g., IB-CS-2018-2019
1. Go to your [GitHub Classroom settings](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/64a051cf1598b9f0658f) and grant **organization access** to the class organization you created.
1. Go to your [GitHub Classroom home page](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) and click on the **Create Classroom** button to create a new classroom for this class. You will be prompted to:
   - Select the organization that you created for the class, the name is truncated, so it helps to remember the avatar (it is also likely to be the last one).
   - Rename the classroom.
   - Add additional administrators.
   - Create the class roster (you can skip this step and return to do it later).
   - Create the first assignment (click on the button, but you won't create the assignment unless you have already requested private repos and gotten a response back).
1. In the assigment interface, click on the button to request private repos. To complete the request, you will need an image of your staff ID showing the current academic year.


## Individual vs. Group Assignments.
